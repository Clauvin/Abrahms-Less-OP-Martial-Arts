# Abrahms-Less-OP-Martial-Arts
A less OP version of Abrahms OP Martial Arts mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA), for personal use but here in case anyone wants to fork this.

## Fair Warning

I'm doing this, as mentioned before, for my personal use - this repo exists because others demonstrated interest in me nerfing the Abrahms mod.

Being a mod made for personal use means that I don't have any intention of doing a complete rework of every single martial art style here - it's just that in the end of the day, I like the idea of different self-taught styles for survivors depending of which weapons they are using, but when you have a character with Bashing 2, Melee 2 and Evading 2, and he suddenly has 50+ Evading while using Bojutsu...

...yeah, no, not my taste. So, I'm doing changes as they are interesting while I play with the mod.

## Plans

Basically, to nerf martial styles through iteration until I'm confortable using them. I don't have an exact baseline of power for what I want to reach, but expect a fall from OP-tiers of power (as the mentioned Bojutsu above giving 50+ Evading and dealing 100+ damage with overhead strikes to zombies at Day 1).
