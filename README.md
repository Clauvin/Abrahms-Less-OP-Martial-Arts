# Abrahms-Less-OP-Martial-Arts
A less OP version of Abrahms OP Martial Arts mod, for personal use but here in case anyone wants to fork this.

Fair warning: I'm doing this, as mentioned before, for my personal use. This means that I don't have any intention of doing a complete rework of every single martial art style here - it's just that in the end of the day, I like the idea of different self-taught styles for survivors depending of which weapons they are using, but when you have a character with Bashing 2, Melee 2 and Evading 2, and he suddenly has 50+ Evading while using Bojutsu...

...yeah, no, not my taste.
