# Abrahms-Less-OP-Martial-Arts
A less OP version of Abrahms OP Martial Arts mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, version 0.E-10010-gd821da4 (https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA), for personal use but here in case anyone wants to fork this.

This repository has permission of Abrahms to exist and be forked.

## Fair Warning

I'm doing this, as mentioned before, for my personal use - this repo exists because others demonstrated interest in me nerfing the Abrahms mod.

Being a mod made for personal use means that I don't have any intention of doing a complete rework and polishing of every single martial art style here - it's just that in the end of the day, I like the idea of different self-taught styles for survivors depending of which weapons they are using, but when you have a character with Bashing 2, Melee 2 and Evading 2, and he suddenly has 50+ Evading while using Bojutsu...

...yeah, no, not my taste.

So, I'm doing changes as they are interesting while I play with the mod. Feel free to fork and do your changes - if they're interesting to me, I will add those to the mod.

## Plans

Basically, to nerf martial styles through iteration until I'm confortable using them. I don't have an exact baseline of power for what I want to reach, but expect a fall from OP-tiers of power (as the mentioned Bojutsu above giving 50+ Evading and dealing 100+ damage with overhead strikes to zombies at Day 1, or Battoujutsu dealing 2k damage).

After a quick look to Battoujutsu, I'm tempted to rework the whole style for something with ok dodge skills... until the first hit, that should be very very strong but also leave the player with a huge damage and block debuff until he puts his sword back in the scabbard. (battoujutsu shouldn't be the whole of a fighting style but the survivor clearly did not know that...) As I, with Cutting 1, Bashing 4 and Melee 3 manage to do 2k+ damage... yeah, a lot of debuffing will happen.

## What Has Been Done Already

* Bojutsu has been nerfed from "OP God Tier" of strength to, by now, strong with small letters - the style is now more defense focused, and lost a lot of its multiplier buffs, some of its extra buffs and techniques...

...and "The Best Defense is A Good Offense" became _"The Best Defense is a Good Defense, Duh"_ - it raises the player's dodging with each hit but also reduces the player's bashing damage by 0.1, scaled by Str, with each hit. This means that the player can't stay on the same place constantly attacking, or else he will be great on avoiding the hits but will deal almost no damage.

Even after all the changes, this style probably becomes OP at higher Bashing levels. (haven't tested it yet with anything beyond Bashing 4)

* Battoujutsu became _Self-Taught Battoujutsu_, a Dex and Per based style focused on dealing as running toward the enemy or waiting it come, then dealing as much damage as possible with the first strike... and then running for your life as the _Unsheated Blade_ debuff kicks in and all your cut damage gets a severe nerf for a good while.

I'm still working on it: things to consider are if all damage should be nerfed by Unsheated Blade or only cut damage, and if the style will be fully focused on one strike or if the survivor should have some very basic hand-to-hand stun techniques to defend himself until Unsheated Blade is over.
